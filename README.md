# Rubik's Cube Solver
Rubik's Cube Solver

Biggest project I'm working on. Using Human Thistlethwaite Algorithm (for interpretability and debugging).

TODO: 
- Stuck at final step, investigate why + add a way to parallelize the different random choices to make the solve faster.
- Remove dependencies + unnessesary files / code
